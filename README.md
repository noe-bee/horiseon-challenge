# horiseon-challenge

## Description

- This project consisted of a disorganized starter html code and css style sheet with minimal semantic strucutre. My task for this particular project was to refactor it, or in other words, clean up the code without changing its functionality. This will allow the code/website become more accessible for both users and developers. While refactoring this project code, I learned that, although time consuming, putting time into polishing, organizing, and commenting code saves time and frustration in the long run for whenever it is needed to refer back to. It also makes the code look more visually appealing.
